Task Description: Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow user to encrypt and decrypt images.

Prerequisites:

1. Python 3.x: If you don't have Python installed yet, you can download it from python.org.
2. NumPy Library: Ensure the NumPy library is installed to handle array operations efficiently. 
3. PIL or Pillow Library: You need to install the Pillow library to use the Image module. Add it to your prerequisites.
    
Installation: Clone or download this repository, compile and run the program.
